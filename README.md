# OOP - Terminal tic-tac-toe

## [Collaborative Project]

In this project, we focus on building a terminal-based, tic-tac-toe game in Ruby. The focus is to use object oriented programming with Ruby to build a game that can be lanuched in the terminal. There are instructions on launch and play the game. 

You can find the original project specification [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

## How to download and run the game
- If you don't have Ruby installed, you will need to download and install it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
- Download the git repository from [here](https://github.com/edwinmoradian90/tic-tac-toe).
- Once both are installed, open a terminal of your choice and find the location of the repository you just downloaded.
```bash
 cd /location/of/the/repo    
```
- Once you're in the repository named "tic-tac-toe", enter the following in the terminal.
```bash
 ruby ./bin/main.rb
```
- After entering the above code, you should see the game run. 
- Next we will look at how to play the game.

## How to play the game

- You will be prompted to input a number between 1-9. The game will only work if you input these numbers. 
- Each number corresponds to a one of nine boxs, so for example, 1 would place an "X" in the first box, etc.
- The game consists of X's and O's where the object is to put three of the same symbol, X or O, in a row.
- The symbols can be stacked horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Once a player gets three together, the game is over. If no one gets three together, the game is considered to be a draw. 
- Once a player wins, or the game is a draw, the program will automatically terminate, printing which player won.

## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- It includes a descriptive README file.
- Inline comments only when considered necessary.
- Files not related to the project are added to `.gitignore`.
- Code is kept [clean](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp).
- Debugging instructions not included
